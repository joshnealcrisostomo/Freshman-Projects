Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I have compiled a collection of beginner projects I worked on during my freshman year as I progressed from having zero Computer Science knowledge to being a beginner programmer.

The programs you'll encounter utilize the Command Line Interface (CLI), the Model-View-Controller Principle (MVC), and the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
