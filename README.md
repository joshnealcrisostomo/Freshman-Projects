# Freshman Year Projects
Welcome to my Github repository, where I have compiled a collection of beginner projects I worked on during my freshman year at De La Salle University - Manila. 

The programs you'll encounter utilize the Command Line Interface (CLI), the Model-View-Controller Principle (MVC), and the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Paradigms and Languages
